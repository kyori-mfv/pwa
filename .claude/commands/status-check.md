description: Check current project status and priorities
---

Perform a comprehensive project status check:

**Check these areas:**
1. **Project Structure** - Verify core directories exist (src/, docs/, etc.)
2. **Development Phase** - Determine current phase from development plan
3. **Active Tools** - List implemented tools in src/tools/
4. **Architecture Health** - Check core patterns implementation
5. **Dependencies** - Verify package.json and installed dependencies
6. **Known Issues** - Identify any blocking problems

**Output Format:**
- Current development phase
- Project structure completeness
- List of active/completed tools  
- Next priority tasks
- Any blocking issues

Please analyze the codebase and provide a clear status summary with actionable next steps.
