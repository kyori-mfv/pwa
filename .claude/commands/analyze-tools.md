description: Analyze all tools and generate maintenance overview
---

Analyze all tools in the project and generate comprehensive overview:

**Analysis Scope:**
1. **Tool Discovery** - Scan `src/tools/` directory for all tools
2. **Structure Analysis** - Verify each tool follows architectural patterns
3. **Dependency Mapping** - Identify tool relationships and integrations
4. **Health Assessment** - Check implementation completeness
5. **Integration Overview** - Map event bus communications
6. **Performance Analysis** - Identify potential bottlenecks

**Tool Health Metrics:**
- Component implementation status
- Pattern compliance score
- Integration completeness
- Test coverage level
- Documentation quality

**Deliverables:**
1. **Tool Registry Report** - List all tools with status
2. **Architecture Overview** - System-wide tool relationships
3. **Integration Map** - Tool communication flows
4. **Maintenance Recommendations** - Priority improvements needed
5. **Development Roadmap** - Next tools to build or enhance

**Output Format:**
```
