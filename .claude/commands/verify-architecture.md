description: Full architecture health check and compliance verification
---

Perform comprehensive architecture verification:

**Architecture Components to Check:**
1. **Core System** - Plugin registry, command manager, event bus
2. **Project Structure** - Directory organization and naming conventions
3. **Pattern Implementation** - Design patterns consistency across tools
4. **Type Definitions** - TypeScript interfaces and type safety
5. **Integration** - Tool communication and event handling
6. **Testing** - Test coverage and testing patterns

**Required Directories:**
- `src/core/registry/` - Plugin registry system
- `src/core/commands/` - Command pattern implementation
- `src/core/events/` - Event bus system
- `src/shared/components/` - Shared UI components
- `src/shared/hooks/` - Shared React hooks
- `src/shared/types/` - TypeScript definitions
- `src/tools/_template/` - Tool template

**Verification Criteria:**
- Directory structure compliance
- Design pattern consistency
- Code convention adherence
- Integration completeness
- Documentation quality

**Output:**
- Architecture score (percentage)
- Detailed compliance report
- Recommendations for improvements
- Priority fixes needed

Please analyze the entire project architecture and provide a comprehensive health assessment.
